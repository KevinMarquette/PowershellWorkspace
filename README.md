My Blog: http://kevinmarquette.github.io

This is my very first git repo. It contains some of my early work and other odd scripts that I don't have a home for. None of this is published in the PSGallery.


This is also a general dumping ground for experiments and code clips that I don't plan on polishing or doing much with.

This is my first git repo. Using it as a place to store various script and modules that I create in my free time.

Changes in v1.0.2
  Added DriverInf property
    Allows you to provide the location to the driver's inf file to be used during printer installation
  Modified Ensure="Absent"
    Will remove the printer port if the removed printer was the last one using it
    Will remove the driver only if the DriverInf is defined and the removed printer was the last one using it
